# FCPSDiscordAlerts
 
The past few days in Fairfax County Public Schools, we have had a lot of snow days. I got tired of spam refreshing the website to check if school was cancelled so I made a discord bot to alert me instead!

# How to use

1. Ensure that python is installed (anything 3.10+)
2. Paste your discord bot token into token.txt (your token should be the only line in there)
3. Inside of main.py, on the line that says CHANNEL_ID = 123456789, replace the current value with the channel id of the channel that you want to receive alerts in.
4. Open up command prompt/terminal inside of the folder with the 2 files and type "py main.py"
5. Everything is now set up, you should now receive alerts for FCPS closures and delays!
